# ⚡ HACKLAB

> Your terminal hacking playground.

Spin up vulnerable lab environments with one command, track objectives, and hack at your own pace — all from the terminal.

```

## Requirements

- **Go 1.21+** (to build from source)
- **Docker** (to run lab containers)
- **Docker Compose** (usually bundled with Docker Desktop)

## Install

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HackLab-cli/hacklab.git
cd hacklab
go build -o hacklab .
sudo mv hacklab /usr/local/bin/
```

### Go install

```bash
go install github.com/HackLab-cli/hacklab@latest
```

### Verify

```bash
hacklab --version
hacklab --help
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `hacklab list` | List all installed labs with slug, name, difficulty, objective count |
| `hacklab start <slug>` | Spin up Docker containers and launch the interactive TUI |
| `hacklab status` | Show currently running labs |
| `hacklab stop <slug>` | Tear down a lab's containers |
| `hacklab add <source>` | Install a lab from a git repo or local path |
| `hacklab remove <slug>` | Remove a lab from your collection |

## Interactive TUI

Starting a lab opens a fullscreen terminal session. It's a **checklist / todo tracker** — no flag guessing, no quizzes. You hack, you check it off.

    ○  1. Bypass login with SQL injection        [injection]
    ○  2. Steal admin JWT token                  [auth]
  ▸ ○  3. Access admin panel                     [broken-auth]

  ↑/↓ navigate  ·  space/enter toggle  ·  h hint  ·  q quit
```

**Controls:**
- `↑/↓` or `j/k` — navigate objectives
- `space` / `enter` — mark an objective as done
- `h` — reveal hints for the selected objective
- `q` — quit

Progress saves automatically to `~/.hacklab/progress.json`.

## Starting guide

The first time you install `hacklab` without prior labs, it will guide you through the process and how to add some example labs!

## Lab Format

Labs are directories with a `lab.yml` manifest. Just create a folder, write the YAML, and you've got a lab.

### Single container

```yaml
name: OWASP Juice Shop
version: "1.0"
description: "Find and exploit 5 vulnerabilities in a modern web app"
difficulty: beginner
author: you
tags: [web, owasp, sqli, xss]

image: bkimminich/juice-shop:latest
port: 3000

wait_for: "http://localhost:3000"
wait_secs: 45

objectives:
  - name: "Bypass login with SQL injection"
    category: "injection"
    hints:
      - "Try the email field"
      - "Classic: ' OR 1=1 --"

  - name: "Perform a reflected XSS attack"
    category: "xss"
    hints:
      - "Look for search functionality"
      - "Try injecting a script tag"
```

### Multi-container (docker-compose)

```yaml
name: SQL Injection Lab
version: "1.0"
description: "Practice SQLi against PHP + MySQL"
difficulty: beginner

compose_file: docker-compose.yml

wait_for: "http://localhost:8080"
wait_secs: 30

objectives:
  - name: "Bypass login authentication"
    category: "sqli"
    hints:
      - "Try: admin' -- "

  - name: "Dump user credentials"
    category: "sqli"
    hints:
      - "Use UNION-based injection"
      - "Table is called 'users'"
```

Drop a `docker-compose.yml` in the same directory. Containers are automatically labelled with `hacklab.lab=<slug>` for tracking.

## Storage

Everything is local, no cloud, no accounts:

```
~/.hacklab/
├── labs/              ← your installed labs
│   ├── juice-shop/
│   │   └── lab.yml
│   └── jwt-lab/
│       └── lab.yml
└── progress.json      ← completion state
```

## Extending

Labs are just folders with a `lab.yml`. That's it. No API to learn, no SDK. Write one, share it as a git repo, and anyone can install it with `hacklab add`.
